# Course Guide

These instructions are intended to get you from having nothing installed, to running a simple exploration of some fanfic projects. Wherever possible I've adjusted these instructions to work on Mac OS X.

## Instructions for use

This guide is split into two portions: **Instructions** and **Context**.

**Instructions** can be found in this Github folder, linked above. They're numbered in the order you'll be following them in. These contain the barebones instructions for getting everything running.

**Context** is the document you're reading right now - it's not going to step you through technical instructions - instead, it'll provide context for **why** we're doing things and try and explain steps that might be confusing.

You'll start on this **Context** page, learn why we're following these steps, then jump into the appropriate **Instructions** page, and then once you're done, jump back to **Context** so you can hopefully understand how what you just did fits into the bigger picture.

Occasionally, I'll offer **Digressions**. These will dive a little deeper into tool usage than **Instructions**, and serve as a reference if you want to use those tools outside this guide.

Let's get started.

# 1 - Setup

In this step we're going to be installing some basic tools of the trade.

**Python** is the language a lot of exploratory linguistics/data science researchers use. That's because it's a lot simpler than other languages, and it's easy to install libraries for it with **pip**.

Libraries are collections of code for performing certain tasks - these libraries can be huge and general, or they can do very specific things, like the default libraries for basic math that come installed with Python.

For example, we're eventually going to install and use a Python library called **pandas** to explore our data.  

A big advantage of Python is you can use something called **pip** to quickly install and setup Python libraries. (pip installs something called dependencies automatically, which are the libraries that your package requires ) Once pip is installed, you can type `pip install [package]` to install most packages.
