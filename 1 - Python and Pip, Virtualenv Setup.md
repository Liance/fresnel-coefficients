If you don't have Python 3.6 already (you can check by typing `python -V` into a Terminal window) follow the Install Python 3.6 steps.

Otherwise skip straight to Install Django/Virtualenv on a Mac OS X or Linux steps.

### Step 2

Follow the same website's instructions to install Pip and virtualenv.

In step *4. Create a new virtual env*, you don't need to name the virtualenv `yourenv`.

Activate the virtualenv you've created.

You don't need to follow step 6!
